# Causal Inference 

## Randomized controlled tests (RCTs)

Selecting *users* at random to be part of controlled and treated *group*

#### Problems
1. Experiment may be impossible
2. Experiment takes to long
Therefore 



## Challenges to Causal Inference
1. Confounders 
	A variable whose presence affects the variables being studied so that the results do not reflect the actual relationship. A variable that isn't controlled for that can have some casual affect on the dependant. (random)
	
2. Selection Bias
	The sampling does not represent larger samples 

3. Counterfactuals
	??


## Assumptions needed to make
1. Causal Makarov Condition
