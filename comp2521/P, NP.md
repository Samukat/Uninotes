- P
- NP
- NP-Complete

### Solving vs Verifying
**Solving:** How hard is it to bind or guess the current answer
**Verifying**: Given an answer, how hard is it to verify it is correct

#### Hard Problems
Often take a ridiculous amount of time to solve with standard computers
Most have time complexities of O(n!) or O(k^n) or worse. i.e non-[[Performance Analysis|polynomial time|]]  

(non-deterministic polynomial time)

#### Easy Problems
Problems that we say is [[Performance Analysis|polynomial time|]]

## Terminology
P: polynomial
- Can be solved in polynomial time
- Can be verified in polynomial time

NP: Non-deterministic polynomial
- Can be solved in non-deterministic polynomial time
- Can be verified in polynomial time

NP-Complete:
- Can be solved **only** in non-deterministic polynomial time
- Can be verified in polynomial time
- (most NP problems we talk about will be NP-Complete)
